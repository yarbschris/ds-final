    "## Intro\n",
    "Our names are Christopher Yarbro and Lakeland Galinson. We are seniors at Tulane University studying Computer Science. This website will host the code, figures, and anything else necessary for our Final Project in Data Science.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The goal for this project** is to explore geographic crime data in the city of New Orleans. We will aim examine the relationship between crime frequency and type to location and create an interactive visualization showing crime/police reports on a map.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Questions\n",
    "1. How do reported crimes and 911 calls vary by zoning type across New Orleans?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Are commercial or mixed-use zones associated with greater crime density than residential zones?/n\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Do certain categories of crime (e.g., property, violent, nuisance) appear disproportionately in specific zoning areas?\n",
    "\n",
    "These questions will guide both exploratory visualizations and later statistical testing in our final tutorial."
